\chapter{User Testing}

This chapter describes the methodology and results of user testing conducted on the previously proposed and designed gamification features for English Mind. The testing focused on evaluating the clarity, intuitiveness, and potential effectiveness of the new gamification elements.

\section{Testing Methodology}

Two distinct user groups were selected for testing to provide diverse perspectives. Group A consisted of participants with prior experience using language learning applications, while Group B included participants without significant experience in this area.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Group A (Experienced Users):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 6 participants aged 18-45
        \item Regular users of apps like Duolingo, WordUp, or Duocards
        \item Familiar with gamification concepts through regular usage of language learning applications (even without knowing the formal terminology)
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Group B (Novice Users):}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 6 participants aged 18-45
        \item Interest in learning English vocabulary
        \item Limited exposure to language learning applications
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The testing was conducted in a controlled, quiet environment where participants interacted with high-fidelity interactive prototypes on mobile devices. Each session lasted between 30-45 minutes and was documented through screen and audio recordings.

Data collection during the testing sessions combined several methods to gather comprehensive feedback about the gamification features. Participants were encouraged to think aloud while interacting with the prototype, sharing their thoughts and reactions to different elements. This verbal feedback was supplemented by observation notes documenting user behavior, particularly noting any points of confusion or excitement. After completing the test scenarios, participants filled out a structured questionnaire rating various aspects of the gamification features on a 5-point Likert scale (see Table \ref{tab:questionnaire}). The questionnaire focused on key metrics such as feature clarity, perceived usefulness, and likelihood of maintaining engagement.

\section{Test Scenarios}

\subsection*{Test Scenario 1: Practice Flashcards Experience}
This scenario evaluates the core practice flow, focusing on three key gamification elements that users encounter during a typical practice session:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Various Flashcard Types}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Clarity of instructions for each flashcard type 
        \item Perceived value of variety in maintaining engagement
        \item Comfort level with each flashcard type's interaction method
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Individual Word Progress Tracking}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Recognition and interpretation of the five-stage progress indicator
        \item Understanding how progress advances through practice
        \item Visibility and placement of the progress indicator
        \item Motivational impact of seeing word progress
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Post-Practice Review}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Comprehension of practice statistics
        \item Impact of celebratory animations and mascot interactions
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Participants will complete a full practice session, encountering each element naturally. They will be encouraged to share their thoughts about the gamification features as they experience them, with particular attention to: intuitiveness of the interface, emotional response to progress indicators and celebrations, perceived effectiveness in maintaining motivation, and any points of confusion or suggestions for improvement.

\subsection*{Test Scenario 2: Streak System}

This scenario evaluates the user's understanding and perception of the streak system, focusing on how users interact with and feel about maintaining streaks:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Understanding Streak Activation and Maintenance}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Clarity of instructions on how to activate and maintain a streak
        \item Awareness of daily requirements to keep the streak active
        \item Recognition of streak status indicators and their meanings
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Motivational Impact}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Perceived motivation to engage with the app regularly due to the streak system
        \item Feedback on the visual and interactive elements associated with streaks
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Participants will be guided through a scenario that simulates maintaining a streak and will be encouraged to share their thoughts on the streak system. The focus will be on their understanding of the requirements for maintaining a streak, their emotional engagement, and any suggestions for improving the streak experience.
