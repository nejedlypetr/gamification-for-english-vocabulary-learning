\chapter{Introduction}

In today's fast-paced digital world, language learning applications have become an essential tool for individuals seeking to enhance their vocabulary and language skills. However, maintaining user engagement and motivation over time remains a significant challenge. This project addresses this issue by exploring the integration of gamification elements into the English Mind application, aiming to transform the learning experience into a more engaging and rewarding journey.

\section*{Objective}

The English Mind application is built on a well-designed learning approach that effectively supports language acquisition. However, when compared to leading competitors, it falls short in terms of gamification elements. This lack of engaging features may negatively impact user motivation and retention, as users are increasingly drawn to applications that offer interactive and rewarding experiences. 

This project aims to address this gap by integrating gamification strategies that can enhance user engagement and motivation, thereby positioning English Mind more competitively in the market.
